<h1>🎯 Number Guessing Game with Smart Hints</h1>

<p>Welcome to the <strong>Number Guessing Game</strong> — but with a twist! This isn't your average "too high, too low" experience. Instead, you get <strong>intelligent feedback</strong> based on your guess, the midpoint of the range, and how far off you are. 🧠</p>

<h2>🚀 Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>🔢 <strong>Dynamic Range Input</strong>: You choose the upper limit, and the computer picks a number within it.</li>
  <li>🧭 <strong>Midpoint Logic</strong>: The game calculates the midpoint and gives you directional hints based on your guess.</li>
  <li>💡 <strong>Smart Feedback</strong>: Instead of exact numbers, you get estimates like "less than midpoint but bigger than your guess" — making it more challenging and fun!</li>
  <li>🔁 <strong>Recursive Guessing</strong>: Keep guessing until you hit the target, with each round narrowing your search.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🛠️ How It Works</h2>
<ol>
  <li>You input a number like <code>100</code> — the computer randomly picks a number between <code>0</code> and <code>100</code>.</li>
  <li>You guess a number.</li>
  <li>Based on your guess and the midpoint, the game gives you <strong>fuzzy hints</strong> to guide you.</li>
  <li>You keep guessing until you nail it 🎉</li>
</ol>

<h2>📦 Sample Output</h2>
<pre>
Enter the final range for computer to generate a random number (e.g., 100):
Enter a number between 0 and 100:
Computer generated number is less than 50 but still bigger than your currently guessed number…
🎉 Number guessed correctly!
